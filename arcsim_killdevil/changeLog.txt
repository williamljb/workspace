Handle relinking has already been fixed in KillDevil arcsim (maybe by Tanya), so original adding on initresume() of runphysics.cpp removed.

10/03/2016: 

apply_transformation_onto() in mesh.cpp and NodeHandle::get_constraints() in handle.cpp has changed, applying transformation on y as well and use y to define relax point of node handles to fix the bug of gradually moving of handles between resumed frames.
